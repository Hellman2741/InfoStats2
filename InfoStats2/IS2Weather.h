/** IS2Weather is used to access a wide variety of weather data directly sourced from Apple's weather framework. It communicates with the daemon provided with InfoStats2 to update data in the background whenever a call to update occurs.
 
 On each update, if the user has enabled Location Services then a new location will be found before updating data. This ensures that the most accurate data is returned.
 
 If Location Services is not enabled, then the first city in the Weather app will be used as a basis for data retrieval.
